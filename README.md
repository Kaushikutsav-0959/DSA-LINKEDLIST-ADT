# DSA-LINKEDLIST-ADT
A complete, hand-built Linked List Abstract Data Type implemented in modern C++. This project demonstrates a deep, low-level understanding of pointer-based data structures — including singly linked lists, circular linked lists, merging, in-place reversal, sorted insertion, loop detection (Floyd’s cycle algorithm), and more.

Concepts Practised
	•	Raw pointer manipulation (node*, node**, references)
	•	Dynamic memory allocation using new / delete
	•	Traversal using temporary pointers
	•	Edge case handling (empty list, single element, head ops)
	•	Time complexity awareness in linked structures
	•	Circular list behavior and loop detection patterns

  This repository serves as:
	•	A DSA learning milestone
	•	A clean implementation reference for beginners
	•	A foundation for advanced data structures like:
	•	Doubly linked list (next milestone)
	•	LRU Cache
	•	Graph adjacency lists
	•	Memory allocators
	•	Undo/Redo stacks
