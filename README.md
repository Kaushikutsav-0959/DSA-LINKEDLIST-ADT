# DSA-LINKEDLIST-ADT
A complete, hand-built Linked List Abstract Data Type implemented in modern C++. This project demonstrates a deep, low-level understanding of pointer-based data structures — including singly linked lists, circular linked lists, merging, in-place reversal, sorted insertion, loop detection (Floyd’s cycle algorithm), and more.
