# DSA – Linked List ADT (C++)

A complete singly-linked list implementation in C++, covering core operations, advanced manipulations, and circular-list support.

## Features

- Create from array  
- Display (iterative & recursive)  
- Search (with move-to-head optimization)  
- Sorted insertion / arbitrary insertion  
- Deletion by key or index  
- Remove duplicates (sorted list)  
- Merge two sorted lists (in-place)  
- In-place reversal (pointer-based)  
- Concatenation of lists  
- Circular-list conversion + circular insertion/deletion  
- Loop detection with Floyd’s algorithm  

## Build & Run

```bash
g++ ll1.cpp -o linkedlist
./linkedlist
